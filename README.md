# EventVis

Project overview : 
The web application displays events within the user’s locality based on data collected from UMass Amherst campus pulse, relevant social media posts, and user submitted events. It allows the user to view all events filtered by dates and view them in a list and a geographical map format. Users can upload their own events directly, can sign up for events and leave comments under events to interact with other users.
